- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Georgedepi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learnig programming espescially python.
- I have some coumputer background knowledge but never tried programing before.
- I like it becouse it seems abstract, and learning takes focus. 
- Right know Im focusing on Data Structures & how to manipulate them.
- Any suggestions on how to learn faster Im all ears.
- I learning using the python documentation and running small snippets of code.
- I want to be able to formulate an idea in my mind and be able to execue it with Python
